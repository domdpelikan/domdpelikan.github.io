## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1
One of my favorite labs would be the first lab we ever did. This was the first lab where I learned how to use GitHub and the repository, open a file using the terminal, and clone a repository. This was one of the most valuable labs we have done, and I'm thrilled I know how to use this in my life. 

Lab 2
Another key lab that I enjoyed was the second lab we did. In this lab, I learned something very important: knowing how to use the terminal and push my code out is very valuable. This lab has taught me something I will be able to use forever, and I will always value this lab.

Lab 6
In lab 6, I found using the make function and checking our code very useful. I like this lab because I use the make test to check what I need to fix where I am having trouble, and I can see what needs to be improved, as well as the make lint. This lab has taught me how to properly test out some linting and formatting to make sure my code is turned in properly.
